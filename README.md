# Angular e-Commerce App

This project was built from a course by Chad Darby at https://www.udemy.com/course/full-stack-angular-spring-boot-tutorial/ . 

### My additions are primarily layout (added responsive CSS Grid for product display [mobile first]), custom icons and style.


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
